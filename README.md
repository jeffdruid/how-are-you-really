# Firebase Security Rules

Firestore Rules
The following rules secure access to the Firestore database. The rules enforce that users can only access their own data and set permissions for posts, comments, replies, notifications, and follow relationships.

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users collection
    match /Users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;

      // Notifications subcollection
      match /Notifications/{notificationId} {
        allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
        allow create: if request.auth.uid != userId && request.resource.data.fromUserId == request.auth.uid && isValidNotification();
        allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }

    function isValidNotification() {
      return request.resource.data.keys().hasOnly(['type', 'fromUserId', 'postId', 'commentId', 'replyId', 'created_at', 'read'])
        && request.resource.data.type in ['like', 'comment', 'follow']
        && request.resource.data.created_at == request.time
        && request.resource.data.read == false;
    }

    // Posts collection
    match /Posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;

      // Allow update for owners or when only 'likeCount' is updated
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || // Owners can update any fields
        (
          request.writeFields.size() == 1 && request.writeFields.hasOnly(['likeCount'])
        )
      );

      allow delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;

      // Likes subcollection for posts
      match /Likes/{likeId} {
        allow read: if request.auth != null;
        allow create, delete: if request.auth.uid == likeId;
      }

      // Comments subcollection
      match /Comments/{commentId} {
        allow read: if request.auth != null;
        allow create: if request.auth != null;

        // Allow update for owners or when only 'likeCount' is updated
        allow update: if request.auth != null && (
          request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId ||
          (
            request.writeFields.size() == 1 && request.writeFields.hasOnly(['likeCount'])
          )
        );

        allow delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;

        // Likes subcollection for comments
        match /Likes/{likeId} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null;
          allow create, delete: if request.auth.uid == likeId;
        }

        // Replies subcollection
        match /Replies/{replyId} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null;
          allow create: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;

          // Allow update for owners or when only 'likeCount' is updated
          allow update: if request.auth != null && (
            request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId ||
            (
              request.writeFields.size() == 1 && request.writeFields.hasOnly(['likeCount'])
            )
          );

          allow delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;

          // Likes subcollection for replies
          match /Likes/{likeId} {
            allow read: if request.auth != null;
            allow create, delete: if request.auth.uid == likeId;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Follows collection
    match /Follows/{followId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.followerId;
      allow delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.followerId;
    }

}
}
```

Storage Rules
The following Firebase Storage rules restrict access to user profile pictures and post images. Profile pictures are private to each user, while post images are publicly accessible.

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
match /b/{bucket}/o {

    // Allow users to upload and read their profile pictures
    match /profile_pictures/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Allow authenticated users to upload files to posts
    match /post_images/{postId}/{fileName} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if true; // Make post images publicly readable
    }

    // Deny all other accesses
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }

    // Allow read access to 'default_profile.jpg' to anyone
    match /default_profile.jpg {
      allow read: if true;
    }

}
}
```

Explanation
Firestore Rules: Rules are applied to user documents, posts, comments, replies, likes, and follows, ensuring only authorized users can create, update, or delete specific data.
Storage Rules: Profile pictures are restricted to each user, and post images are publicly accessible. The default_profile.jpg file is readable by anyone.

## Testing

All testing was done manually and automated using Django's built-in testing framework. The application was tested for functionality, user experience, and security. Test cases were created to cover user stories and edge cases, ensuring the application works as expected.
